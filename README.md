## Purpose

Glow Girl is a unique women's health website designed for confidentiality and FakeCover. With security features and multilingual translations, accessing information is safer and more private. Plus, Glow Girl is also available as a Progressive Web App, so you can download the website directly onto your device;  in cultures where discussing these topics can be difficult, your privacy is ensured.
