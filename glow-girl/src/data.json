With PCOS, your body may have high amounts of two hormones: androgen and insulin. These hormonal issues can cause changes in your body’s ability to release an egg (ovulate) and can lead to irregular periods, ovarian cysts, trouble getting pregnant, and other symptoms.</p><h2>What are the symptoms of PCOS?</h2><p>PCOS symptoms include:<ul><li>Irregular periods</li><li>Polycystic ovaries, AKA ovarian cysts</li><li>Infertility (trouble getting pregnant) — PCOS is one of the top causes of infertility.</li><li>Excess hair on your face, chest, belly, or upper thighs (sometimes called hirsutism)</li><li>Severe acne or oily skin</li><li>Dark skin patches</li></ul></p><h2>How is PCOS diagnosed and treated?</h2><p>There’s no special test for PCOS. If you’re worried you may have PCOS, a doctor or nurse (like the staff at your nearest Planned Parenthood health center) can help you figure out if that’s what’s going on.<br><br>Your doctor or nurse will look at your skin and measure your weight and blood pressure. They’ll ask questions about your period, any symptoms you may be having, and your personal and family health history. They may do a pelvic exam and blood tests to check your hormone levels, whether you may be pregnant, and more. In some cases, your doctor or nurse may recommend getting an ultrasound to check for ovarian cysts.<br><br>PCOS treatment is different for different people. While there is no cure for PCOS, taking medicine, exercising regularly, eating a healthy diet, and losing weight if you’re obese (i.e. have a BMI over 35) can help your symptoms. If you don’t want to become pregnant, your doctor or nurse may recommend hormonal birth control, like the hormonal IUD, birth control implant, pill, patch, ring, or shot to treat your PCOS. The pill, patch, or ring may be particularly helpful if you’re struggling with acne or want more regular periods. If you’re trying to get pregnant, drugs that treat insulin resistance may help, as well as certain fertility drugs that can help you ovulate. Losing weight can also help with ovulation and fertility.</p>"

Anyone can get a UTI, but they’re more common if you have a vulva.</p><h2>What’s a UTI?</h2><p>A urinary tract infection, or UTI, is an infection in your urinary system, including the <ul><li>bladder — the organ that collects and stores urine</li><li>urethra — the tube that carries urine from your bladder out of your body</li></ul> There are two kinds of UTIs: cystitis and urethritis. Cystitis is an infection of the bladder. Urethritis is an infection of the urethra. If left untreated, either of these can spread and cause a kidney infection. So even though UTIs are really common, you’ve got to take them seriously.</p><h2>What causes UTIs?</h2><p>It’s pretty easy to get a urinary tract infection. Bacteria that live in the vagina, genital, and anal areas may enter the urethra, travel to the bladder, and cause an infection. This can happen during sexual activity when bacteria from your partner’s genitals, anus, fingers, or sex toys gets pushed into your urethra. UTIs can also be caused by chlamydia, gonorrhea, or other organisms.<br><br>Although UTIs aren’t spread from one person to another like STDs, having sex can lead to or worsen UTIs. But you don’t have to have sex to get a UTI. Anything that brings bacteria in contact with your urethra can cause a UTI.<br><br>You’re more likely to get a UTI if you <ul><li>have had one before</li><li>have diabetes</li><li>are obese</li><li>use spermicides or a diaphragm</li><li>have kidney stones or other obstructions in your urinary tract</li></ul>Most people aren’t able to pinpoint the exact cause of their UTI because so many things can lead to it.</p><h2>What are the symptoms of a UTI?</h2><p>One of the most common symptoms of a UTI is a frequent and urgent need to pee. You might feel like you need to pee all the time, even if you just went. Other UTI symptoms include:<ul><li>pain or burning when you pee</li><li>bad-smelling or cloudy urine</li><li>blood or pus in your urine</li><li>soreness, pressure, or cramps in your lower belly, back, or sides</li></ul>If the infection goes to your kidneys, your UTI symptoms may also include:<ul><li>pain in your mid-back (to the right or left of the spine)</li><li>fever</li><li>chills</li><li>nausea</li><li>vomiting</li><li>feeling tired</li></ul>If you have any of these symptoms, tell your doctor right away. Kidney infections are serious and need to be treated immediately.<br><br>These symptoms aren’t always caused by a UTI. Other infections, such as STDs or vaginitis, may cause painful or frequent urination. Only a doctor or nurse can tell for sure if you have a UTI.</p>"
